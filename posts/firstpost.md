Not much clubbing has been going on for over a year now &mdash; in the UK, at least. In this downtime, there have been some important and necessary examinations of how the electronic music industry is in need of a reset. For example, R.O.S.H. published a couple of vital projects ([A LETTER TO RA](http://itsrosh.nfshost.com/letter/) and [MEASURED](http://bit.do/MEASURED)) in 2020 that centered on failings of the UK music press in covering artists from marginalised groups, amounting to structural racism. What questions can be asked of the venues that, today, provide the primary source of income to most working electronic musicians and DJs?

[Fabric](https://www.fabriclondon.com/) is one of the most famous club venues in the world. It opened it's doors in 1999, and has hosted 20+ years of club nights and live gigs from it's permanent Farringdon home (bar a temporary closure in 2016 following [a failed Islington borough council attempt to permanently shutter it](http://collateral.vuelio.uk.com/RemoteStorage/Islington/Releases/6380/Fabric%20-%20Main%20Review.pdf)).
